# Weld Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning (Extended)

This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression to classify weld quality (Good vs Defective) based on key manufacturing process parameters such as impact velocity, flyer angle, yield strength, and waveform type. It simulates real-world applications in high-speed solid-state welding processes like Vaporizing Foil Actuator Welding (VFAW), aligning with Industry 4.0 initiatives.

The project was developed as part of my skill-expansion effort during a postdoctoral tenure in advanced manufacturing. It integrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization â€” all hosted in a Google Colab-ready notebook for easy replication and teaching use.
